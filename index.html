<p>Hi, nice to meet you!👋🏻 </p>
<h3>About me</h3>

<div class="Elisabetta">
<p>
My name is Elisabetta
 and I am a Jonkoping University's student 
 in the programme of New Media Design.
<br /> 
I have 19 years old and I am from Italy,
 where I lived up until moving to Sweden to study.🇮🇹🇸🇪<br />
I have studied languages in Highschool so I can speak English,
 Spanish, French... and Italian of course!
 <br />
Beeing able to communicate with these many people with different culutures 
than mine helped me opening my mind and developing an interest 
for travelling.<br /> I like to frequently explore new activities
 to always keep my brain trained on challenges.

<h3>Why NMD?</h3>One of my passions is Design in all forms: Interior design, Graphic design, Fashion design etc.<br /> Those are also the main reasosn that motivated me to study NMD since it's a programme that includes Design but also challenges me to learn new really interesting informatics skills. </p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>As I told you I like to entratain myself with new challenges
     so I tried various hobbies during my life: origami, candle
      making, ceramics, nail art, breadmaking etc... 
      <br />
      Whenever I can, I like to spend time in the nature, going 
      to the seaside, watch the sunset and relax. I also like ice
       skatin and skiing, so I think I made the right decision 
       choosing to study in Sweden. </p>
